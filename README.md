will-it-scale
=============

Overview
--------
Will It Scale takes a testcase and runs it from 1 through to n parallel copies
to see if the testcase will scale. It builds both a process and threads based
test in order to see any differences between the two.

We rely on hwloc for a platform independent way of laying out tasks on cores.
It can be found at www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/.

Care is taken to try and reduce run to run variability. By using hwloc
we ensure each task is on its own core and won't get bounced around by the
scheduler. The wrapper script (runtest.py) turns off address space
randomisation which can cause huge differences in pagetable related benchmarks
(one run may fit within one pte page, the next may span two). There is a
warmup period before which an average is taken. The averaging period can
be changed with the -s option, which by default is 5 seconds. 

Testcase design
---------------
Each test has two required components. A testcase description:

	char *testcase_description = "Context switch via pipes";

and a testcase() which is passed a pointer to an iteration count that the
testcase should increment. This testcase is run whatever number of times the
user specifies on the command line via the -t option:

	void testcase(unsigned long long *iterations)

A (not very useful) example:

	#include <sys/types.h>
	#include <unistd.h>

	char *testcase_description = "getppid";

	void testcase(unsigned long long *iterations)
	{
        	while (1) {
                	getppid();
                	(*iterations)++;
        	}
	}

If you need to setup something globally such as a single file for all
parallel testcases to operate on, there are two functions:

	void testcase_prepare(void)
	void testcase_cleanup(void)

Finally if you need a new task such as when you want to write a context
switch benchmark between two tasks, you can use:

	void new_task(void *(func)(void *), void *arg)

This takes care of creating a new process or a new thread depending on
which version of the test is being run.

Quick start:

	make
	./runalltests

Postprocessing and graphing
---------------------------
The graphing scripts use dygraphs, a client side javascript graphing package.
You need to download it at:

http://danvk.org/dygraphs/dygraph-combined.js

Note: dygraphs will only work on a web server since it uses XMLHttpRequest.
You can't just point your web browser to a local file.

Right now the script is pretty horrible but will probably work:

	./postprocess > index.html

Then copy dygraph-combined.js *.csv index.html to your web directory:

	scp *.csv index.html dygraph-combined.js <destination>

The graphs show number of tasks run on the x axis vs performance (in operations
per second) on the left y axis. We also plot the amount of idle time against
the right y axis. In the ideal case we should have an X pattern, with
operations per second increasing and idle time decreasing.
